## Getting started

### Performance Testing with cURL

#### Overview

The cURL program is widely available across many different platforms, which makes it an obvious choice for network testing.
It is simple, scriptable, and flexible – which is why it is so powerful.
It supports many protocols, but we are going to focus on HTTP.

The basic syntax for a cURL command is pretty straightforward – just add the destination URL:

```shell
$ curl http://google.com
```

For this simple command, curl will return the result. That usually means a bunch of HTML will be sent to your console.
For the example command above, we get the following:

```shell
$ curl http://google.com

<HTML><HEAD><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8">
<TITLE>301 Moved</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<H1>301 Moved</H1>
The document has moved
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/">here</A>.
</BODY></HTML>
```

Remember, curl is not a browser, so by default it doesn’t follow redirects.
It simply executes the single command that you gave it (in this case, an HTTP GET).
You can output the request headers by adding a **-i** flag to your command:

```shell
$ curl -i http://google.com

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: http://www.google.com/
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Date: Wed, 25 Sep 2019 01:49:23 GMT
Expires: Fri, 25 Oct 2019 01:49:23 GMT
Cache-Control: public, max-age=2592000
Server: gws
Content-Length: 219
X-XSS-Protection: 0
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

<HTML><HEAD><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8">
<TITLE>301 Moved</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<H1>301 Moved</H1>
The document has moved
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/">here</A>.
</BODY></HTML>
```

#### Output Formatting

Curl has a **-w** flag which tells curl to output a certain string of information after the transfer has completed.
Here is a list of available variables:

* content_type
* filename_effective
* ftp_entry_path
* http_code
* http_connect
* http_version
* local_ip
* local_port
* num_connects
* num_redirects
* proxy_ssl_verify_result
* redirect_url
* remote_ip
* remote_port
* scheme
* size_download
* size_header
* size_request
* size_upload
* speed_download
* speed_upload
* ssl_verify_result
* time_appconnect
* time_connect
* time_namelookup
* time_pretransfer
* time_redirect
* time_starttransfer
* time_total
* url_effective

The _man_ command for _curl_ contains detailed information about each variable (including units, etc.).

#### Testing the Sample APP

We can add a few output variables to a GET request, e.g:

```shell
curl -i \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X GET http://localhost:3000/people \
  -w "%{time_connect},%{time_total},%{speed_download},%{http_code},%{size_download},%{url_effective}\n" \
  -o /dev/null
```

Then we'll get something like this:

```shell
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  5868  100  5868    0     0   2523      0  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--  2523
0.005394,2.325165,2523.000,200,5868,http://localhost:3000/people
```

In the same way, we can perform HTTP requests such as  POST, PUT, etc. E.g:

```shell
curl -i \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST http://localhost:3000/people \
  -d @src/people_src.json \
  -w "%{time_connect},%{time_total},%{speed_download},%{http_code},%{size_download},%{url_effective}\n" \
  -o /dev/null
```

Then we'll get something like this:

```shell
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  7610  100    78  100  7532   1182   111k --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  113k
0.015563,0.065978,1182.000,200,78,http://localhost:3000/people
```
